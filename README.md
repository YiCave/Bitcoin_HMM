# Project Title: ON-CHAIN DATA AUTOMATED TRADING MACHINE
## Overview
This project focuses on applying statistical-based Hidden Markov Model(HMM), Natural Language Processing(NLP) that act as an indicators/filters that enhanced the entire backtest process, in order to boost profitability by hitting higher sharpe ratio while achieving the criteria for maximum drawdown and trade frequency.

## Practical Workflow
1. ðŸ“Š HMM Backbone
  - Leverages statistical Hidden Markov Models to identify market regimes and behavioral patterns.

  - Regime prediction (e.g., bull/bear/neutral)

  - Correlation tables between features and hidden states

  - Model selection using BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) and AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)

  - Transition probability matrix visualization

Parameter tuning for optimal number of regimes
3. NLP Support
4. LSTM_CNN OHLCV
