# Project Title: ON-CHAIN DATA AUTOMATED TRADING MACHINE
## Overview
This project focuses on applying statistical-based Hidden Markov Model(HMM), Natural Language Processing(NLP) that act as an indicators/filters that enhanced the entire backtest process, in order to boost profitability by hitting higher sharpe ratio while achieving the criteria for maximum drawdown and trade frequency.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Multiple machine learning Libraries
- Graphing Libraries
- Statistical tools
  
## Practical Workflow
### HMM Backbone
  - Leverages statistical models for features input
  - 
  - Model selection using BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion), AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) 
  - Correlation tables between features
  - Model selection using BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) and AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)
  - Transition probability matrix visualization

  - Parameter tuning for optimal number of regimes
