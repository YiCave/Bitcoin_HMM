# Project Title: ON-CHAIN DATA AUTOMATED TRADING MACHINE
## Overview
This project focuses on applying statistical-based Hidden Markov Model(HMM), Natural Language Processing(NLP) that act as an indicators/ filters that enhanced the entire backtest process, in order to boost profitability by hitting higher sharpe ratio while achieving the criteria for maximum drawdown and trade frequency.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Multiple machine learning Libraries
- Graphing Libraries
- Statistical tools
  
## Practical Workflow
### HMM Backbone
  #### Part 1 - Obtaining Datas and Identify Basic Relationships
  - Features input for visualisation (from distinct endpoints, merged)
  - Correlation tables between features
  - Frequency plots against features
  #### Part 2 - Optimising Model Selection
  - Model selection using BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion), AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and Silhouette score (statistic support)
  - Elbow Plots which visualize the minimisation process, States prediction
  - Regime Classification and Distribution Plots
  - Statistial-based Regime Analysis
  #### Part 3 - Regime Transition Handling
  - Keeptrack regime transition by count
  - Probabilities Conversion
  - Correlation tables between regimes (from and to)
  #### Part 3 - Regime Transition Handling

  
  - Parameter tuning for optimal number of regimes
