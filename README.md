# Project Title: ON-CHAIN DATA AUTOMATED TRADING MACHINE
## Overview
This project focuses on applying statistical-based Hidden Markov Model(HMM), Natural Language Processing(NLP) that act as an indicators/filters that enhanced the entire backtest process, in order to boost profitability by hitting higher sharpe ratio while achieving the criteria for maximum drawdown and trade frequency.

## Practical Workflow
1. HMM Backbone
2. NLP Support
3. LSTM_CNN OHLCV
4. Data Manipulation
5. HMM NLP Signals Integration
6. Features Engineering
7. Weightage Control and Application
8. Backtesting and ForwardTesting

### Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Multiple machine learning Libraries
- Graphing Libraries
- Statistical tools
